# Purpose of car-pooling

The main idea of Car Pooling is that a group of people can ride in one vehicle instead of having individuals driving their own car or riding in hired cars. They can take turns using their cars so that there is savings in terms of money as well as emissions or else ask for one car to pick and ride so as to reduce number of cars deployed.
